# Here is a sample project-template-folder folder structure with the explanation what will happen
# project-template-folder\
#   shipyard.yaml           --> this is the only MANDATORY file. it will be the shipyard for keptn create project
#   dynatrace\
#     dynatrace.conf.yaml   --> will be uploaded to the project level
#   service_demo            --> if a foler with service_ exists it will either create or onboard a new service depending on whether there is a subfolder charts
#     charts                --> if the charts subfolder exists it will do a keptn onboard service demo --charts=./charts otherwise keptn create service
#   stage_quality-gate      --> this folder will be iterated and content will be uploaded to the quality-gate stage
#     dynatrace\
#       dynatrace.conf.yaml --> this will now be a stage specific file
#     demo\                 
#       jmeter\
#         jmeter.conf.yaml  --> this file will be a jmeter.conf.yaml specific to the demo service in the quality-gate stage
